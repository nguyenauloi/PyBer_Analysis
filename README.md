# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Explore the data of the PyBer Summary DataFrame to compare PyBer's ridehsaring services in urban, suburban, and rural cities. We'll be using Python and Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, utilizing Matplotlib, we'll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Python 3.6.1
- Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3)
- Pandas 1.3.5
- Git Bash 2.37.1.windows.1

## Results
In our analysis we conclude several key findings:
 - Urban cities have the highest amount of rides (13x that of Rural cities)
 - Urban cities have the most amount of drivers (~31x that of Rural cities)
 - Rural riders pay 1.41x on average what Urban riders do
 - Urban cities generate 9.21x the amount of revenue that Rural cities do
 - We can also over time (from January 2019 to April 2019) that these trends remain the same

## Summary
From the data we can draw that there is less incentive to utilize ridesharing services in rural cities as well as less incentive to becoming a ridersharer in rural communites. This could be due to several outside factors that we can speculate from the lower population in rural vs urban communites or that maybe car ownership is higher in rural communites. Though the use between communities is drastic, the data shows that there is still regular use of ridesharing in these cities with potential growth as populations naturally increase over time.
